Self is the instance. Its already been made by the time its been called.
It takes the variable radius and populates it in the dictionary.

If you call dir() on a reference and an instance, the instance just has
the instanve variable attached.
    
Clases are not that different from namespaces. If you import a module it looks a
lot like the dict of a class. A class is kind of a smaller contained namespace.
Guido just "indented" it. You can run for loops and print statements inside
classes, which will run when you run the file.

Do not make private methods in python, do use them in languages that use them.
